# Sample Lumen API

Sample Lumen API for managing events. 

Wrote this code for a test and decided to add it to GitHub.


### Models
- Events


### Controllers
- EventsController


### Middlewares
- CorsMiddleware


### Endpoints 
```/events``` endpoint to get all events

```/event/{id}``` endpoint to get details of a single event

```/new/event``` endpoint to create a new event


### TODO
- Authentication
- Create endpoints to update and delete events
